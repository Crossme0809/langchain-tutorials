Pet animals come in all shapes and sizes, each suited to different lifestyles and home environments. Dogs and cats are the most common, known for their companionship and unique personalities. Small mammals like hamsters, guinea pigs, and rabbits are often chosen for their low maintenance needs. Birds offer beauty and song, and reptiles like turtles and lizards can make intriguing pets. Even fish, with their calming presence, can be wonderful pets.
