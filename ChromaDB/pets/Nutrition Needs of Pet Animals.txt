Proper nutrition is vital for the health and wellbeing of pets. Dogs and cats require a balanced diet that includes proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Some may even have specific dietary needs based on their breed or age. Birds typically thrive on a diet of seeds, fruits, and vegetables, while reptiles have diverse diets ranging from live insects to fresh produce. Fish diets depend greatly on the species, with some needing live food and others subsisting on flakes or pellets.
